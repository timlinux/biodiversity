The term **open-source** refers to any computer program in which the source code is openly available for anyone to use, modify at their convenience, or contribute to, whether they are users or other developers.

Open-source software is released under an open-source license so that any interested party can either view or modify the
source code.

There are many open-source projects on GitHub or GitLab, where you can access repositories and become part of the
community by contributing to the projects. For example, Linux, BIMS, or QGIS.
