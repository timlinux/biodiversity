# Getting Started with Django-BIMS

## Get the Source Code

`git clone git://github.com/kartoza/django-bims.git`

## Docker and VSCode

An easy way to set up a local development environment is with Docker and VSCode. In this approach you need to:

* Install the [Visual Studio Code Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) extension in your VSCode
* Click on the Remote status bar in the bottom-left, and then choose **Open Folder in Container** which will cause a
  new VSCode window to open.
* Go to the `development` folder, select `docker-compose.dev.yml`, and then select the service `dev`. This will take
  some time as it builds all of the services.
* Now the message **Dev Containers: Existing Docker Compose (Extent)** will appear in the bottom-left corner of the
  window, and in the VSCode terminal you are going to see: `root@dev:/home/web/django_project#`

## Setup PyCharm to work with a remote Docker development environment

For deployment we use Docker, so you need to have Docker running on the host.

### Build and run your development Docker image

This image extends the production one, adding ssh to it.

Linux and MacOS:

```
make dev
```

### Create a remote interpreter in PyCharm

Open the project in PyCharm and then do the following steps:

* Go to File -> Settings
* Then go to Project Interpreter
* Click on the gear icon next to Project Interpreter
* Click on Add remote...

Now use these credentials:

* SSH Credentials (tick the box)
* Host: localhost
* Port: (use the ssh port specified in the docker-compose.yml file)
* User name: root
* Auth type: password (and tick `save password`)
* Password: docker
* Python interpreter path: ``/usr/local/bin/python``

When prompted about the host authenticity, click `Yes`.
After the python interpreter is setup, set its path mapping:

  * **Local path:** `<path to your git repo>` (where your django project
    located)
  * **Remote path:** `/home/web/django_project`

After that you should see something like this:
   `<Project root>/django_projectâ†’/home/web/django_project`

In settings, Django support:

* Tick to enable Django support.
* Set the Django project root to the path on your host that contains the Django code e.g.
  ``<path to code base>`` (where your django project located)
* Set the settings option to your settings profile e.g.
  ``core/settings/dev_docker.py``. If you need to use custom settings, copy
  this file e.g. ``dev_docker_tim.py`` and make your modifications in your
  personalised copy. The first import of your custom file should import from
  dev_docker.

* Manage script (leave default)

### Create the Django Run Configuration

* Go to Run -> Edit configurations
* Click the `+` icon in the top left corner
* Choose ``Django server`` from the popup list

Now set these options:

* **Name:** Django Server
* **Host:** 0.0.0.0
* **Port:** (use the http port specified in the docker-compose.yml file, e.g. 8080)`*`
* **Run browser** If checked, it will open the url after you click run. You
  should be able to access the running projects on 0.0.0.0:63302 (the port that was
  mapped to 8080)
* **Additional options:** ``--settings=core.settings.dev_docker``
* **Run browser:** Optionally set this to your IP address (MacOS/Linux) or your specific IP address (Windows) followed
  by the port forward address for port 8080 that was specified in your ``docker-compose.yml`` file.
  For example: ``http://0.0.0.0:63302``.
* **Environment vars:** Leave as default unless you need to add something to the env
* **Python interpreter:** Ensure it is set you your remote interpreter ( It should be
  set to that by default)
* **Interpreter options:** Leave blank
* **Path mappings:** Here you need to indicate equivalent paths between your host
  filesystem and the filesystem in the remote (Docker) host. Click the ellipsis
  and add a run that points to your git checkout on your local host and the
  /home/web directory in the Docker host. e.g.
  * **Local path:** `<path to your git repo>`/django_project
  * **Remote path:** /home/web/django_project
  * Click `OK` to save your run configuration

## Setup a Database

Now that you have the application, and need a database to work with, you will need to restore the backup to your local
database.

* Restore Database:

```
docker cp PG_bims_gis.30-September-2022.dmp bims_dev_db:/tmp/PG_bims_gis.30-September-2022.dmp
docker exec -it bims_dev_db /bin/bash 
cd tmp/
pg_restore -d gis -p 5432 -U docker -h localhost -1 PG_bims_gis.30-September-2022.dmp

```
