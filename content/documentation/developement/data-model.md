A [model](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/db/models/) is the single, definitive source of information about
your data. It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data that youâ€™re storing. Generally, each model maps to a
single database table.

As a platform for managing and visualizing biodiversity data, the following models are often used in BIMS:

### `bims.models.biological_collection_record`

### `bims.models.taxonomy`

### `bims.models.location_site`
